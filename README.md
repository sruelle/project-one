OVERVIEW
We will be examining how the Quality of life, Pollution, Cost of Living and Health Care have contributed to suicide rates across several countries.We will also be looking at if gender is a factor. Our data analysis will be representative of suicide rates from 2013 to 2016.

GOALS
Our goal is to be able to answer the following questions:
1.      Do countries with better quality of life have lower suicide rates?
2.      Did suicide rates decrease over the years as Health Care increased?
3.      Did suicide rates decrease over the years as cost of living decreased?
4.      Is suicide rate higher in male than females?

Challenges
Due to the cost of acquiring an API key, the data was exported into csv files
Due to uneven number of countries in our dataset(65) when we divided into three equal ranked groups, we dropped the bottom 2 countries
