Here is our project proposal.

Suicide Rate analysis
19th January 2020

OVERVIEW
We will be examining how the Quality of life; Cost of living and Purchasing Power have contributed to suicide rates across several countries and gender over the years. Our data analysis will be representative of suicide rates from 2013 to 2016.

GOALS
Our goal is to be able to answer the following questions:
1.      Do countries with better quality of life have lower suicide rates?
2.      Did suicide rates decrease over the years as purchasing power increased?
3.      Did suicide rates decrease over the years as cost of living decreased?
4.      Is suicide rate higher in male than females?

DATA SOURCES
Due to the cost of acquiring an API key, the data was imported into csv files
